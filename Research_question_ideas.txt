1. Parameter tuning:
   -Finding the effect that different parameters have on the performance of an algorithm on  DIFFERENT functions.
   -Finding the effect that different parameters have on the performance of computing a solution to a SPECIFIC function.
   -Finding an efficient way of tunning parameters so that they are workable with as soon as possible.
   -Using EAs for parameter tuning.

2. Variety in Population:
   -Verifying how different strategies for maintaing variety work on a function where exploration > exploitation.
   -Finding a way of maintaining enough variety in an EA so that it can be applied for functions regardless of their nature (can be generalized)
